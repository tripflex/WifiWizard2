# WifiWizard2 - 3.0

WifiWizard2 enables Wifi management for both Android and iOS applications within Cordova/Phonegap projects.

This project is a fork of the [WifiWizard](https://github.com/hoerresb/WifiWizard) plugin with fixes and updates, as well as patches taken from the [Cordova Network Manager](https://github.com/arsenal942/Cordova-Network-Manager) plugin.

Version 3.0.0+ has undergone a TON of changes from the original fork (version 2.0), and the majority of method/functions have been changed.  You can find the latest release of version 2 on the [2.1.x branch](https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2/tree/2.1.x)

The recommended version to use is the latest 3+ as that is the version that is actively maintained.

*iOS has limited functionality as Apple's WifiManager equivalent is only available  as a private API. Any app that used these features would not be allowed on the app store.*

**If you are an iOS developer, please consider helping us to resolve the [open iOS issues](https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2/issues/6)**

**If you are an Android developer, please consider helping us to [refactor the current code base](https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2/issues/28)**

**If you're a Cordova developer, please consider helping out this project, open a new issue, a PR, or contact me directly**

## Basics

This plugin creates the object `WifiWizard2` and is accessible after `deviceready` has been fired, see [Cordova deviceready Event Docs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/cordova/events/events.html#deviceready)

```js
document.addEventListener('deviceready', function () {
    // Call some WifiWizard2.method after deviceready fired
}, false);
```

This is really only necessary if you plan on immediately invoking one of this plugin's methods/functions, as the majority of the time you would probably just call the method/function on say, a button click to scan for networks, etc.  Basically if you are going to call something immediately when a webview is shown, make sure to add the event listener for `deviceready` before making that call, otherwise you probably don't need to.

## Async Handling
Because Cordova `exec` calls are made asynchronously, all methods/functions return async promises.  These functions will return the results, or a JavaScript error.  You should use `await` and `try/catch` blocks (or `.then` and `.catch`).  See below for more details, and examples.

**Callbacks are not longer supported in this plugin**

Promises are handled by the [Cordova PromisesPlugin](https://github.com/vstirbu/PromisesPlugin) as an ES6 polyfill if your application does not already define `window.Promise` 

## Demo Meteor Project
To test this plugin as well as provide some example code for others to work off of, I have created an example Meteor project you can find here:

[https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2Demo](https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2Demo)

This demo has examples of using both async functions (with `async/await` and `try/catch` blocks), as well as non async functions with `.then` and `.catch`

## Android Permissions and Notes
In order to obtain scan results (to call `scan` or `startScan` then `getScanResults`) your application must have the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` Android Permission.  You can do this by calling the `requestPermission` method detailed below, or
this plugin will automagically do this for you when you call `scan` or `startScan` functions.

Newer versions of Android will **not** allow you to `remove`, update existing configuration, or `disable` networks that were not created by your application.  If you are having issues using this features, with your device connected to your computer, run `adb logcat` to view Android Logs for specific error.

# Global Functions
These are functions that can be used by both Android and iOS applications
```javascript
WifiWizard2.getConnectedSSID()
```
 - Returns connected network SSID (only if connected) in success callback, otherwise fail callback will be called (if not connected or unable to retrieve)
 - This does **NOT** return the BSSID if unable to obtain SSID (like original WifiWizard did)
```javascript
WifiWizard2.getConnectedBSSID()
```
 - Same as above, except BSSID (mac) is returned
```javascript
WifiWizard2.scan([options])
```
- Same as calling `startScan` and then `getScanResults`, except this method will only resolve the promise after the scan completes and returns the results.

##### Thrown Errors

- `TIMEOUT_WAITING_FOR_SCAN` on timeout waiting for scan 10 seconds +
- `SCAN_FAILED` if unable to start scan

# iOS Functions
For functionality, you need to note the following:
 - Connect/Disconnect only works for iOS11+
 - Can't run in the simulator so you need to attach an actual device when building with xCode
 - Need to add the 'HotspotConfiguration' and 'NetworkExtensions' capabilities to your xCode project

```javascript
WifiWizard2.iOSConnectNetwork(ssid, ssidPassword)
```
```javascript
WifiWizard2.iOSDisconnectNetwork(ssid)
```

# Android Functions
 - **WifiWizard2** *will automagically try to enable WiFi if it's disabled when calling any android related methods that require WiFi to be enabled*

### Connect vs Enable
When writing Android Java code, there is no `connect` methods, you basically either `enable` or `disable` a network. In the original versions of WifiWizard the `connect` method would basically just call `enable` in Android.
I have changed the way this works in WifiWizard2 version 3.0.0+, converting it to a helper method to eliminate having to call `formatWifiConfig` then `add` and then `enable` ... the `connect` method will now automatically call `formatWifiConfig`, then call `add` to either add or update the network configuration, and then call `enable`.
If the connect method is unable to update existing network configuration (added by user or other apps), but there is a valid network ID, it will still attempt to enable that network ID.

```javascript
WifiWizard2.connect(ssid, bindAll, password, algorithm)
```
 - `ssid` should be the SSID to connect to *required*
 - `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection (default is `false`) *optional*
   - See `WifiWizard2.enable` for more details regarding `bindAll` feature
 - `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network
 - Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms
 - For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm
 - These arguments are the same as for `formatWifiConfig`
 - This method essentially calls `formatWifiConfig` then `add` then `enable`
 - If unable to update network configuration (was added by user or other app), but a valid network ID exists, this method will still attempt to enable the network
 - Promise will not be returned until method has verified that connection to WiFi was in completed state (waits up to 60 seconds)

##### Thrown Errors
 - `CONNECT_FAILED_TIMEOUT` unable to verify connection, timed out after 60 seconds
 - `INVALID_NETWORK_ID_TO_CONNECT` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config
 - `INTERPUT_EXCEPT_WHILE_CONNECTING` Interupt exception while waiting for connection



### Disconnect vs Disable
Same as above for Connect vs Enable, except in this situation, `disconnect` will first disable the network, and then attempt to remove it (if SSID is passed)

```javascript
WifiWizard2.disconnect(ssid)
```
 - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 - `ssid` is **OPTIONAL** .. if not passed, will disconnect current WiFi (almost all Android versions now will just automatically reconnect to last wifi after disconnecting)
 - If `ssid` is provided, this method will first attempt to `disable` and then `remove` the network
 - If you do not want to remove network configuration, use `disable` instead

##### Thrown Errors
 - `DISCONNECT_NET_REMOVE_ERROR` Android returned error when removing wifi configuration
 - `DISCONNECT_NET_DISABLE_ERROR` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config
 - `DISCONNECT_NET_ID_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID to disconnect/remove (from passed SSID)
 - `ERROR_DISCONNECT` - Android error disconnecting wifi (only when SSID is not passed)

```javascript
WifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig(ssid, password, algorithm)
```
 - `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network
 - Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms
 - For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm
```javascript
WifiWizard2.formatWPAConfig(ssid, password)
```
 - This is just a helper method that calls `WifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig( ssid, password, 'WPA' );`

```javascript
WifiWizard2.add(wifi)
```
 - `wifi` must be an object formatted by `formatWifiConfig`, this **must** be done before calling `enable`

##### Thrown Errors
- `AUTH_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED` - Invalid auth type specified
- `ERROR_ADDING_NETWORK` - Android returned `-1` specifying error adding network
- `ERROR_UPDATING_NETWORK` - Same as above, except an existing network ID was found, and unable to update it

```javascript
WifiWizard2.remove(ssid)
```
 - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 - Please note, most newer versions of Android will only allow wifi to be removed if created by your application

##### Thrown Errors
 - `UNABLE_TO_REMOVE` Android returned failure in removing network
 - `REMOVE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID


```javascript
WifiWizard2.listNetworks()
```

```javascript
WifiWizard2.startScan()
```
 - It is recommended to just use the `scan` method instead of `startScan`

##### Thrown Errors
 - `STARTSCAN_FAILED` Android returned failure in starting scan


```javascript
WifiWizard2.getScanResults([options])
```
- `getScanResults` should only be called after calling `startScan` (it is recommended to use `scan` instead as this starts the scan, then returns the results)
- `[options]` is optional, if you do not want to specify, just pass `success` callback as first parameter, and `fail` callback as second parameter
- Retrieves a list of the available networks as an array of objects and passes them to the function listHandler. The format of the array is:
```javascript
networks = [
    {   "level": signal_level, // raw RSSI value
        "SSID": ssid, // SSID as string, with escaped double quotes: "\"ssid name\""
        "BSSID": bssid // MAC address of WiFi router as string
        "frequency": frequency of the access point channel in MHz
        "capabilities": capabilities // Describes the authentication, key management, and encryption schemes supported by the access point.
        "timestamp": timestamp // timestamp of when the scan was completed
        "channelWidth":
        "centerFreq0":
        "centerFreq1":
    }
]
```
- `channelWidth` `centerFreq0` and `centerFreq1` are only supported on API > 23 (Marshmallow), any older API will return null for these values

An options object may be passed. Currently, the only supported option is `numLevels`, and it has the following behavior: 

- if `(n == true || n < 2)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will return data as before, split in 5 levels;
- if `(n > 1)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will calculate the signal level, split in n levels;
- if `(n == false)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will use the raw signal level;

```javascript
WifiWizard2.isWifiEnabled()
```
 - Returns boolean value of whether Wifi is enabled or not
```javascript
WifiWizard2.setWifiEnabled(enabled)
```
 - Pass `true` for `enabled` parameter to set Wifi enabled
 - You do not need to call this function to set WiFi enabled to call other methods that require wifi enabled.  This plugin will automagically enable WiFi if a method is called that requires WiFi to be enabled.

##### Thrown Errors
 - `ERROR_SETWIFIENABLED` wifi state does not match call (enable or disable)

```javascript
WifiWizard2.getConnectedNetworkID()
```
 - Returns currently connected network ID in success callback (only if connected), otherwise fail callback will be called

##### Thrown Errors
 - `GET_CONNECTED_NET_ID_ERROR` Unable to determine currently connected network ID (may not be connected)

## New to 3.0.0+
```javascript
WifiWizard2.isConnectedToInternet()
```

 - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping `8.8.8.8`
 - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
 - If you called `connect` or `enable` and passed `true` for `bindAll`, your application will force the ping through wifi connection.
 - If you did not pass `true` (or passed `false`) for `bindAll`, and the wifi does not have internet connection, Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will use cell connection to ping (due to Android using cell connection when wifi does not have internet) [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)

```javascript
WifiWizard2.canPingWifiRouter()
```

 - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping the connected WiFi router IP (obtained from DHCP info)
 - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
 - This is useful for testing to make sure that your Android app is able to connect to the private network after connecting to WiFi
 - This was added for testing the `bindAll` feature to support issues with Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) not routing calls through WiFi if WiFi does not have internet connection [See Android Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)

```javascript
WifiWizard2.enableWifi()
```

```javascript
WifiWizard2.disableWifi()
```

```javascript
WifiWizard2.getWifiIP()
```
 - Returns IPv4 address of currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if IP not found or wifi not connected

```javascript
WifiWizard2.getWifiRouterIP()
```
 - Returns IPv4 WiFi router IP from currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if unable to determine, or wifi not connected

##### Thrown Errors
 - `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)

```javascript
WifiWizard2.getWifiIPInfo()
```
 - Returns a JSON object with IPv4 address and subnet `{"ip": "192.168.1.2", "subnet": "255.255.255.0" }` or rejected promise if not found or not connected
##### Thrown Errors
 - `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)

```javascript
WifiWizard2.reconnect()
```
 - Reconnect to the currently active access point, **if we are currently disconnected.**

##### Thrown Errors
 - `ERROR_RECONNECT` Android returned error when reconnecting

```javascript
WifiWizard2.reassociate()
```
 - Reconnect to the currently active access point, **even if we are already connected.**

##### Thrown Errors
 - `ERROR_REASSOCIATE` Android returned error when reassociating


```javascript
WifiWizard2.getSSIDNetworkID(ssid)
```
 - Get Android Network ID from passed SSID

```javascript
WifiWizard2.disable(ssid)
```
 - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 - Disable the passed SSID network
 - Please note that most newer versions of Android will only allow you to disable networks created by your application

##### Thrown Errors
 - `UNABLE_TO_DISABLE` Android returned failure in disabling network
 - `DISABLE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID to disable


```javascript
WifiWizard2.requestPermission()
```
 - Request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permssion
 - This Android permission is required to run `scan`, `startStart` and `getScanResults`
 - You can request permission by running this function manually, or WifiWizard2 will automagically request permission when one of the functions above is called

##### Thrown Errors
 - `PERMISSION_DENIED` user denied permission on device


```javascript
WifiWizard2.enable(ssid, bindAll, waitForConnection)
```
 - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
 - `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection
    - Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will not route connections to the WiFi device if it does not have internet connection.  Passing `true` to `bindAll` will force Android to route connections from your Android app through Wifi, regardless of internet connection.
    - If you are having problems connecting to a local IP through WiFi because it does not have internet, try enabling `bindAll` and this should fix the problem.
    - During my testing, some versions of Android (5.0 - 7.1.2) would still route connections through WiFi without internet, but it was random that some versions would and would not work.
    - Testing Android Oreo+ (8.0.0+) if wifi does not have internet, 100% of the time it would NOT route connections through WiFi, so you *must* enable this for Oreo or newer to route connections from your application through wifi without internet.
    - When `bindAll` is enabled, *ALL* connections from your app will be routed through WiFi, until you call `disconnect` or `disable`
    - See the Google Android Blog for [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
    - This feature *ONLY* works for Android Lollipop+ (API 21+), if device is running API older than 21, `bindall` will be ignored (as API older than 21 does this by default)
 - Enable the passed SSID network
 - You **MUST** call `WifiWizard2.add(wifi)` before calling `enable` as the wifi configuration must exist before you can enable it (or previously used `connect` without calling `disconnect`)
 - This method does NOT wait or verify connection to wifi network, pass `true` to `waitForConnection` to only return promise once connection is verified in COMPLETED state to specific `ssid`

###### Thrown Errors
`UNABLE_TO_ENABLE` - Android returned `-1` signifying failure enabling

```javascript
WifiWizard2.timeout(delay)
```
 - `delay` should be time in milliseconds to delay
 - Helper async timeout delay, `delay` is optional, default is 2000ms = 2 seconds
 - This method always returns a resolved promise after the delay, it will never reject or throw an error

###### Example inside async function:
```javascript
await WifiWizard2.timeout(4000);
// do something after 4 seconds
```

###### Example inside standard non-async function:
```javascript
WifiWizard2.timeout(4000).then( function(){
    // do something after waiting 4 seconds
}):
```

```javascript
WifiWizard2.resetBindAll()
```
 - Will force device to use a newtowrk with internet, Essenitally un-binding the connection.

```javascript
WifiWizard2.setBindAll()
```
 - Will force device to route all netwrok requests through the connected netwrok, Essenitally binding the connection.


### Installation

##### Master

Run ```cordova plugin add https://github.com/tripflex/wifiwizard2```

To install from the master branch (latest on GitHub):

If you are wanting to have the latest and greatest stable version, then run the 'Releases' command below.

##### Releases
Run ```cordova plugin add wifiwizard2```

##### Meteor
To install and use this plugin in a Meteor project, you have to specify the exact version from NPM repository:
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/wifiwizard2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wifiwizard2)

As of 4/12/2018, the latest version is 3.0.0:

```meteor add cordova:wifiwizard2@3.0.0```

### Errors/Rejections
Methods now return formatted string errors as detailed below, instead of returning generic error messages.  This allows you to check yourself what specific error was returned, and customize the error message.
In an upcoming release I may add easy ways to override generic messages, or set your own, but for now, errors returned can be found below each method/function.

#### Generic Thrown Errors
`WIFI_NOT_ENABLED`

### Examples

Please see demo Meteor project for code examples:

[https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2Demo](https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2Demo)

I recommend using [ES6 arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) to maintain `this` reference.  This is especially useful if you're using Blaze and Meteor.

```javascript
this.FirstName = 'John';

wifiConnection.then( result => {
   // Do something after connecting!
   // Using arrow functions, you still have access to `this`
   console.log( this.FirstName + ' connected to wifi!' );
});
```
